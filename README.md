# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived based on features such as age, fare, class, etc.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for EDA.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `models/`: Saved trained models.
- `data/`: Contains the Kaggle-provided `train.csv` and `test.csv`.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
